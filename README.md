# Heart Failure Prediction Using Big Data and Machine Learning with R

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart failure in patients using machine learning algorithms applied to a big dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various health-related attributes, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The goal is to analyze the dataset using the R programming language and build predictive models to identify patients at high risk of heart failure.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Predictive Modeling using Machine Learning (Classification, Clustering, and Regression)
- Data Visualization using ggplot2 and other R libraries
- Analysis of the relationship between health factors and heart failure risk

## Technologies Used
- **R Language** for data analysis and machine learning
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **Machine Learning** algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in RStudio.
3. Run the provided R scripts to replicate the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).
